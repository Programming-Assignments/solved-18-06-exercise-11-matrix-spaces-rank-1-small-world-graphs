<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>11.1:</strong> [Optional] (3.5 #41. <em>Introduction</em> <em>to</em> <em>Linear</em> <em>Algebra:</em> Strang) Write the 3 by 3 identity matrix as a combination of the other five permutation matrices. Then show that those five matrices are linearly independent. (Assume a combination gives <em>c</em><sub>1</sub><em>P</em><sub>1 </sub>+ ··· + <em>c</em><sub>5</sub><em>P</em><sub>5 </sub>= 0 and check entries to prove <em>c<sub>i</sub></em> is zero.) The five permutation matrices are a basis for the subspace of three by three matrices with row and column sums all equal.

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>11.2:</strong> (3.6 #31.) <strong>M</strong> is the space of three by three matrices. Multiply each matrix <em>X</em> in <strong>M</strong> by:




<em>A</em>




Notice that <em>A</em> .

<ol>

 <li>Which matrices <em>X</em> lead to <em>AX</em> = 0?</li>

 <li>Which matrices have the form <em>AX</em> for some matrix <em>X</em>?</li>

 <li>Part (a) finds the “nullspace” of the operation <em>AX</em> and part (b) finds the “column space.” What are the dimensions of those two subspaces of <strong>M</strong>? Why do the dimensions add to (<em>n</em> − <em>r</em>)+ <em>r</em> = 9?</li>
